# Amazon Recommendation Engine

Since its inception nearly 25 years ago, Amazon has been focused on delivering a world class customer experience. In a world where consumer choice is paramount, Amazon continues to need better ways to target new and existing customers by presenting them with products they are most likely to purchase. The key to solving this problem lies in one of Amazon’s greatest data assets: customer reviews.

Amazon has a subset of customers who write reviews about their purchased products (reviewers). Reviewers tend to be more engaged with Amazon’s platform, giving Amazon the ability to increase product exposure with this segment. By mining historical reviews for information on product preference and sentiment, Amazon can understand and utilize reviewer preference to develop a more personalized product recommendation experience for each reviewer.
